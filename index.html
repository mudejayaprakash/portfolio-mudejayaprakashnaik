    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a full-time master’s student in the Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics (AIBA) program at the University of South Florida, expecting to graduate in May 2026.
My analytics journey began during my undergraduate years at IIT Roorkee, where I discovered how mathematics, computer languages, and problem-solving could shape real-world outcomes. Over the past six years, I’ve worked across manufacturing, e-pharma, fintech, retail, and NGOs—tackling challenges from predictive maintenance in heavy engineering to personalized marketing in retail. These experiences convinced me of the transformative power of data analytics to solve complex business problems and improve lives.
This is actually my second master’s degree—my first was in Organisation Development, Change, and Leadership at TISS Mumbai. That program was less about numbers and more about people, it gave me a strong grounding in communication, change management, and self-awareness. Now, I’m combining that perspective with advanced analytics and AI to create solutions that are not just technically sound but also human-centered.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about meaningful conversations, philosophy, and cultural exploration. Every discussion feels like a chance to learn, and every new culture adds depth to how I see the world. 
Looking ahead, my goal is to harness AI and analytics to unlock smarter decisions, design innovative solutions, and drive sustainable business success.
